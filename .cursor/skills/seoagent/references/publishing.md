# Publishing Target Decision

Articles need a working place to live before they're worth generating. The good news: **you (the coding agent) are the publishing engine.** You have full repo access and can read exactly how this project's content/CMS works — so you can publish a finished article to wherever the user's content *already lives*, with no SEOAgent-specific infrastructure. Don't make the user adopt a new system; meet their content where it is.

**The decision is just: where does this site's content live?** Almost always one of:

- **A. In the repo** (markdown / MDX / Astro content collections / a static-site generator) → you write the file.
- **B. In a CMS** (WordPress, Sanity, Contentful, Strapi, Shopify, Ghost, Webflow, Payload, Notion, …) → you publish via the API the repo already uses.

SEOAgent Cloud *hosting* (option C below) exists only as a convenience for users who have **no** content home and no engineering resources — it is NOT the default. Never lead with it.

> **Guardrail — the "DB-backed / headless blog with no repo files" trap.** Some sites have a blog *route* (`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`, `/posts/[slug]`, …) that renders rows from a **database or headless store** — the app's own Postgres/Supabase, an internal admin API, a headless setup — while the **repo contains no content files** for it. When you find this, an existing route + a live `/blog` does NOT mean you've found the publishing path. Do **NOT**:
> - **write directly into that production database** (e.g. an `INSERT` via an MCP/SQL tool) — that's not how the app publishes, it bypasses every safeguard, and it's usually read-only anyway; and
> - **assume SEOAgent Cloud (or a "dashboard") will publish it** — the cloud does not publish to the user's own site. Never invent a publishing mechanism you haven't verified.
>
> Instead, **the default recommendation is to make the blog repo-native: add a git-based Markdown/MDX content collection** (option A) — a `content/blog/` dir the route reads from — so publishing becomes a reviewed commit, no extra services. If the user would rather keep the DB/headless setup, **ask them how a post actually gets created** (which API endpoint or command produces a live page) and record it as option B / `other` — never guess. When a site has no working content home at all, **recommend creating a Markdown collection as the default**, ahead of adopting a CMS or the cloud.

**Trigger this protocol when:**

- Phase 1 raised a `critical` `upstream_dependency_unreachable` or `page_renders_empty` finding on a content path (e.g., `/blog`, `/docs`, `/resources`)
- `project.md` has no `cms` and no `blog_path`, and the user wants to start publishing
- The user explicitly asks "where should I publish my blog posts?" or "my blog is broken — what now?"
- **The publishing source changed** — the user tells you they switched/removed their CMS or moved the blog, OR you notice it while working (CMS client code / deps / env vars added or removed, a new `app/blog/**` or `pages/blog/**` route appeared, or the `cms` recorded in `project.md` no longer has any supporting signal in the repo). Go to **"Re-detecting the publishing target"** below — `project.md` is only as good as its last detection, and a stale `cms`/`blog_path` silently misroutes every future article.

Figure out the destination from the codebase first (you usually already know it from `init`'s CMS detection + `blog_path`, and from `pages.md`). Only ask the user if the repo is genuinely ambiguous.

## A. The repo (default for any repo-based site) — `strategy: mdx_sync`

The site renders content from files in this repo (Next.js `content/`, Astro `src/content/`, a `_posts/` dir, MDX routes, a static-site generator, etc.).

- **How you publish:** **Read an existing published article first** to learn the exact location, filename convention, and frontmatter shape this site expects. Then write the article **directly into a new file in that same location** (Phase 4 step 7), matching that frontmatter exactly (their field names, their date format, their tags). Inject internal links + image refs. If a route/sitemap entry is needed and missing, add it. **The repo file is the single source of truth for the body** — do NOT also write a full-body copy into `.seoagent/`.
- **Register it so the cloud sees it:** after the repo file is written, run `seoagent content track --slug {slug} --url https://{domain}{blog_path}/{slug} --file {path}` (Phase 4 step 7). That's what makes the article appear on the dashboard — `sync` only walks `.seoagent/`, so a repo-only article is otherwise invisible to the cloud. The track record is a pointer, not a duplicate.
- **First post / just-converted blog (no existing file to copy):** if the content dir is empty — a brand-new blog, or one you're converting from a DB/headless source per the guardrail above — define a simple frontmatter convention yourself (`title`, `description`, `date`, `tags`, `slug`) and, if the route doesn't yet read from files, scaffold the loader + route to read the content dir (this is the one-time setup task in "After the user picks", tracked with `setup_status: pending` until it deploys).
- **Ship it the way the repo ships:** open a PR (or commit to a branch) so the user's existing CI/CD deploys it. Never push straight to the default branch without asking.
- **Best for:** any site whose content is in version control. This is the most common case and the highest-control path.

## B. The user's CMS (default for CMS-backed sites) — `strategy: custom`

The site pulls content from a CMS. You don't need a SEOAgent adapter — **read how the repo already talks to the CMS** (the existing fetch/SDK code, the env var names) and mirror it to *create* a post.

- **How you publish:** find the CMS client/credentials the app already uses (`.env*`, an SDK import, an API base). Map the article (`title`, `slug`, body, meta, canonical, JSON-LD) to that CMS's content model and create the entry — print the exact `curl`/SDK call for the user to run, or, with explicit consent, run it yourself using their existing credentials. Confirm the post is a draft vs. published per the user's preference. The CMS holds the body; **then `seoagent content track --slug {slug} --url {live-url}` so the dashboard tracks it** (the cloud can't see your CMS).
- **Mapping starting points:** Strapi → `POST /api/articles` `{data:{…}}`. Sanity → `client.create({_type:'post',…})`. Contentful → Management API `createEntry`. Webflow → `POST /collections/:id/items`. Shopify → `POST /admin/api/.../articles.json`. Ghost → Admin API `posts.add`. WordPress → `POST /wp-json/wp/v2/posts`. For anything unfamiliar, ask the user once how a post gets created, then store the mapping in `project.md` so future articles are one step.
- **Best for:** teams with an existing CMS — keep it, just get SEOAgent's content into it.

## C. SEOAgent Cloud hosting (optional — only when there's no content home) — `strategy: managed_proxy` | `subdomain`

For users with no repo content path and no CMS who don't want to build one. Requires `seoagent login`. Two shapes:

- **Managed proxy** (`managed_proxy`): a one-time rewrite (`/blog/*` → `https://proxy.seoagent.com/{site-token}/blog/*`) so posts render at `{domain}/blog/{slug}` on the user's own domain (full link equity).
- **Hosted subdomain** (`subdomain`): a CNAME from `blog.{domain}` — easiest, but a separate-site SEO trade-off.
- Only suggest these if A and B genuinely don't apply. They're a convenience, not the recommended path.

## Other / let me describe my setup — `strategy: other`

Homemade CMS, an unusual static pipeline, Notion-as-CMS, etc. Ask the user to describe their publish flow in plain English (what command/API produces a live page), capture it in `project.md` under `publishing.notes`, and treat it like A or B — you generate the file or API call per article.

## After the user picks

`Edit` `project.md` to record the choice:

```yaml
publishing:
  strategy: managed_proxy | subdomain | mdx_sync | custom | other
  cms: strapi | wordpress | sanity | contentful | webflow | shopify | ghost | payload | other  # only when strategy is custom or other
  blog_path: /blog                          # canonical URL prefix on the live site
  content_dir: content/blog                 # repo-root-relative dir where article files live (mdx_sync — lets sync auto-track from article #1)
  setup_status: pending | done              # done = the one-time setup task is complete
  notes: "Free-text — e.g., 'rewrite added to next.config.js on 2026-04-28'"
```

Then:

1. Append a one-time setup task to `roadmap.md` under "High" — e.g., "Add Vercel rewrite for /blog/* → proxy.seoagent.com" or "Scaffold app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx for MDX sync". Mark it `[ ]` until the user confirms it's deployed.
2. Append to `changelog.md`: `[date] Publishing strategy: {strategy} ({cms or n/a})`.
3. Run `seoagent sync`.
4. Stop. **Do not generate briefs or articles until `setup_status: done`** — when the user confirms the rewrite is live (or the MDX route deploys, or the CMS credentials work), `Edit` `project.md` to set `setup_status: done` and continue to Phase 3.

## Re-detecting the publishing target (when it changes)

`init` detects `cms` + `blog_path` **once**, at install. Nothing re-runs that automatically — so when the user re-architects how content is published (a very common moment: ripping out a broken CMS, moving the blog into the repo, switching CMS), `project.md` goes stale and every later phase trusts the wrong destination. When any "publishing source changed" trigger above fires, re-detect and reconcile **before** writing briefs or articles:

1. **Re-derive from the repo** — the same signals `init` uses:
   - **CMS** — dependencies in `package.json` (`strapi`/`@strapi/*`, `@sanity/client`/`next-sanity`, `contentful`, `@tryghost/content-api`, `webflow-api`, `@shopify/*`, `payload`/`@payloadcms/*`, `@directus/sdk`, `wpapi`/`wp-graphql`) and CMS env vars (`STRAPI_URL`, `SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`, `GHOST_URL`, `WORDPRESS_API_URL`, …). No CMS signal + local markdown under `content/`, `_posts/`, `src/content/` → `mdx-local`. No signal at all → repo-rendered routes (`mdx_sync`, `cms` omitted).
   - **blog_path** — the live route file: `app/blog/page.tsx`, `src/app/blog/page.tsx`, `pages/blog/index.tsx`, or the `/articles`, `/posts`, `/learn`, `/resources` equivalents.
2. **Diff against `project.md`** (`publishing.cms`, `publishing.strategy`, `blog_path`). If they match, do nothing — say "publishing setup unchanged" and move on.
3. **If they differ, PROPOSE — don't auto-rewrite.** Show the before/after in one line with your evidence: e.g. *"`project.md` says `cms: strapi`, but the Strapi deps + `STRAPI_URL` are gone and `/blog` now renders from `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`. Update to `strategy: mdx_sync`, drop `cms`, keep `blog_path: /blog`?"* Wait for the user's yes.
4. **On confirmation, `Edit` `project.md`:** update `publishing.strategy`, `publishing.cms` (remove the key when there's no CMS — never write the literal `none`), and `blog_path`. **If the `strategy` changed**, the old one-time setup no longer applies → reset `publishing.setup_status: pending` and re-run "After the user picks" (new roadmap task + re-verify the target is live via the Phase 3 Step 0 WebFetch). If only `cms`/`blog_path` shifted within the same strategy, keep `setup_status`.
5. Append to `changelog.md`: `[date] Publishing re-detected: {old} → {new}`. Run `seoagent sync`.

If you spot the drift incidentally (mid-audit, mid-edit), surface it as a one-line heads-up + offer rather than blocking — re-detect only when the user agrees, or when you're about to act on the stale target (Phase 3+).

## Where the article body lives — one source of truth

The publishing strategy decides where an article's **body** is written. Never write it twice.

- **`mdx_sync` / `custom`** — the body lives in the **repo file or CMS entry**, NOT in `.seoagent/`. Match the site's existing frontmatter and content model exactly (read an existing article first). Tracking is automatic once `publishing.content_dir` is set: the next sync registers the file. Only when no content dir is declared *and* nothing is tracked yet, run once:
  `seoagent content track --slug {slug} --url https://{domain}{blog_path}/{slug} --file {path}`
  (it self-records `content_dir`). **Never hand-write a duplicate full-body `.seoagent/content/{slug}.md`** — two copies of one article drift, and the sync then reports both.
  **Publishing a cloud-delivered draft under a different slug?** Add `--supersedes {the-delivered-slug}` (and `--action {action_id}`). Renaming a generated slug is good editorial practice, but `content track` keys on the slug — without the claim the cloud keeps the original as an unfinished draft and re-delivers the same article. See `docs/harness/DESIGN-article-identity.md`.
- **`managed_proxy` / `subdomain`** (cloud-hosted) — the body **does** live in `.seoagent/content/{slug}.md` with full SEO frontmatter (schema in `references/schemas.md`), published by `seoagent sync`.

Either way: ship repo articles the way the repo ships — PR or branch, never straight to the default branch without asking.

## Images — never block publishing on them

Always write `images:` frontmatter with `alt` + `prompt` (or `src` for a captured screenshot). If `project.md` has `image_provider`, offer `seoagent generate-image --prompt "..." --out .seoagent/content/images/{slug}-hero.png`. If it's absent, run `seoagent env-check` first — it detects keys added after `init` and records the provider. Still nothing → offer the one-line key ask, then **write prompts only and continue publishing**. Images are never a blocker.

For SaaS sites (`site_type: saas`, or a repo rendering real product UI), capture real product screenshots per `references/screenshots.md` for hero/feature/how-to spots **before** falling back to generated images.
